# Building With Responsive Design

This repository contains a mockup of the [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/) homepage. Homepages change though, so this format of the homepage contains the featured content from June 24, 2019.

The goal when recreating this homepage was to mimic the responsive design aspects of the actual TNW homepage. Likewise, this recreation offers responsive sizing that occurs at the **1024px** and **768px** browser widths. Appropriate row and column changes, along with navigation and overall formatting will occur when you switch your browser window to said sizes, so give them a try.
